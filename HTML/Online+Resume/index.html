    <H3>Summary</H3>
    <p>
        Dedicated second-year Computer Science student with a passion for web development, specifically in backend technologies. 
        During my academic journey, I've gained valuable knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. 
        My coursework, along with hands-on experience in C#, ASP.NET Web API, Microsoft SQL Server has equipped me with the skills necessary for backend development.
        I possess a solid understanding of essential concepts in backend development, including Entity Framework, REST, and RESTful APIs. Eager to apply my programming skills in real-world scenarios,
        I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in practical experiments and contribute to innovative projects. With a keen interest in .NET and backend technologies, I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with like-minded professionals to create impactful web solutions.
